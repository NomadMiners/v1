Risk Statement
Purchasing cryptographic tokens involves substantial risk and may lead to a loss of a substantial portion or the entire amount of the purchase price. Before purchasing any crypto tokens, prospective purchasers should carefully assess and take into account the risks, including those listed in any other documentation. No person should purchase cryptographic tokens for speculative purposes. Prospective purchasers should only purchase tokens if they fully understand the nature of these tokens. 

The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens and digital assets is currently unsettled, varies among jurisdictions, and is subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that, in the future, certain laws, regulations, policies, or rules relating to cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology, or blockchain applications may be implemented which may directly or indirectly affect or restrict cryptographic token holders’ right to acquire, own, hold, sell, convert, trade, or use cryptographic tokens. 

The uncertainty in tax legislation relating to cryptographic tokens and digital assets may expose cryptographic token holders to tax consequences associated with the acquisition, disposal, conversion, use or trading of cryptographic tokens. Digital assets and related products and services carry significant risks. Potential purchasers should take into account all of the above and assess the nature of, and their appetite for, relevant risks independently and consult their advisers before making any decisions. You should consult a lawyer, accountant, tax professional, and/or any other professional advisors as necessary before determining whether to purchase cryptographic tokens.






Introduction
Cryptocurrency mining is the competitive process that verifies and adds new transactions to the blockchain for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work (PoW) method. The miner that is selected is rewarded with some amount of the currency and/or transaction fees. Currently, there is a stigma that cryptocurrency mining is harmful to the environment due to its high energy requirement and powerful computers needed to process transactions.

Luna Miners is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that mines PoW cryptocurrencies and shares the profits generated with Luna Miner’s NFT holders managed by smart contracts. All mining profits will be sent to a multi-chain wallet where they will be converted to UST or Luna. From this wallet, the funds will be distributed to Luna Miner’s treasury wallet on the Terra blockchain. The treasury will hold 10% of monthly profits to minimize environmental footprint, expand mining operations, and invest in future projects. All remaining funds will be sent to a community wallet and distributed accordingly to the community vote.

All assets bought by the Luna Miners DAO will be 100% owned by the NFT holders. All rights to any miners purchased by the DAO belong to the NFT holders. If a holder chooses to sell their NFT, they sell their right to vote in the Luna Miner DAO in addition to any other benefits that NFT comes with.

Mission
Luna Miner’s mission is to develop a fully transparent mining facility that is also environmentally sound. In addition to this, this DAO will bring more liquidity to the Terra ecosystem and provide a new source of passive income for people and protocols. This project allows the community to reap the benefits of a crypto mining operation without maintenance, deep knowledge of hardware and blockchain, operating expenses, and overall hassle. 

How it Works (Voting)
All voting will take place at the end of each month. We will be integrating Gravi DAO’s technology into our project to ensure all voting is done fairly and securely. This system will ensure all Luna Miner’s polls are conducted fairly.

For early supporters of the project, we will be launching a separate collection called Miner Cards. These collectors will give the holder 2 votes for each miner card in every DAO poll. Miner Card holders will automatically be whitelisted for the Luna Miners NFT mint. Miner Card holder will also receive 10% of the Luna Miner NFT sales in addition to eligibility to receive special airdrops. 
●	Miner Card = 2 DAO votes
●	Luna Miner NFT = 1 DAO vote

* A wallet holds 1x Miner Card and 1x Luna Miner NFT will have a total of three vote in any DAO poll.

Roadmap





Long-Term Vision
Luna Miners is looking to build a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem and mining facility that offsets the energy requirements with green technology. Luna Miners aims to utilize solar power to offset electricity costs and electricity generated from harmful sources. In addition to this, the heat the miners will also be repurposed for environmentally sound purposes. By minting a Luna Miner NFT or Luna Miner Card, you will be helping decentralize and secure multiple ecosystems, proving mining can be environmentally sound.
